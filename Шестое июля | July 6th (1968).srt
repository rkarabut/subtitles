1
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,160
July 4th 1918

2
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,940
On this day in Moscow, the 5th All-Russian Congress of the Soviets
of Worker, Peasant, Red Army and Cossack deputies was starting.

3
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Petrozavodsk.

4
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,770
To the chrezvoenkom* Natsarenus.
<i>* emergency military comissioner</i>

5
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm passing your telegram

6
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,480
to the Narkomprod*.
<i>* The People's Commissariat of Food Supply</i>

7
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,280
Food supply is at its worst.

8
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,520
The bread expected from Tsaritsyn...

9
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,880
- Vladimir Ilyich, excuse me, you
have to be there an hour earlier.

10
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
- ...is still not here.

11
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,060
There's none being passed out today.

12
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Not in Peter*,
<i>* St Petersburg</i>

13
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,610
not in Moscow.

14
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
In the upcoming days

15
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,560
we can't be of any help.

16
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
We are bled

17
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
absolutely dry.

18
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Are you here for me?

19
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:55,441
For the chair committee.

20
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,070
They're on the second floor.

21
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,840
- And Yakov Mikhaylovich?..
- I think he's around.
- Thank you.

22
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,970
You have to

23
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,110
mobilize

24
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,550
all the best

25
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,660
to send troops to the
Czechoslovakian front.

26
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Without victory over Czechoslovakians

27
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,260
there will be no bread.

28
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,710
Predsovnarkoma* Ulyanov-Lenin.
<i>* Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars</i>

29
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,200
Excuse me. Greetings.

30
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,360
We had an emergency meeting
of the Central Committee.

31
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,330
Take you seats, comrades.

32
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,520
And we were already ready to plan
the Congress' proceedings without you.

33
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,380
And now on to the construction
of the Congress' presidium.

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Same principle.

35
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,080
One presidium member for every fifty delegates.
No objections?

36
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,410
Consequently,

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
the Bolsheviks have fourteen seats,

38
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,380
the Left SRs have six,

39
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,720
the Maximalists...

40
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
- There's only thirty of us.

41
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,620
- And six Internationalist Democrats.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,340
- Two more could still turn up.

43
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,620
- Or three.
- Alright.

44
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,110
Your parties' representatives

45
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,330
will get seats on the mandates commission.

46
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,650
Therefore...
- Our party delegates for the Congress presidium shall be Karelin,

47
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,790
Golubovsky,

48
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Kolegayev,

49
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,070
Spiridonova,

50
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,375
Kamkov

51
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
and Cherepanov.

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,190
Cherepanov... Good.

53
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,676
The agenda seems to be as follows:

54
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:20,946
Sovnarkom*'s and VTsIK**'s reports,
<i>*Council of People's Commissars</i>
<i>**All-Russian Central Executive Committee</i>

55
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,159
the question of food security,

56
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,413
the military question,

57
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,206
the ratification of the constitution.

58
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,260
We would think it necessary to
add local reports to the agenda.

59
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,163
I'm afraid it would significantly drag out our work.

60
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,480
But I fully agree with the Maximalists.

61
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,236
We do as well.

62
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,460
We do need local reports.

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,770
Let's hear them out on
factional meetings then.

64
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
Any objections?

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,310
Any suggestions or additions?

66
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,130
Our party suggests emphasizing
the Brest Peace question.

67
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:49,080
I don't think it expedient. The Brest Peace
question will be brought up in reports and debates.

68
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Certainly in the debates.

69
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:52,903
I think we can agree with that.

70
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,630
So be it.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,760
About the makeup of the mandates commission...
- Yes?

72
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,720
- On second thought, we will fight you
on the Congress itself over this question.

73
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,020
Perhaps, considering the stressful times...

74
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,320
Afraid of the criticisms?

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,343
I'm afraid of bloody quarrels

76
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,170
between two Soviet parties.

77
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,692
- Assuming though that both parties
<i>are</i> Soviet.
- I agree with you on that.

78
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,200
- If only we'd always find common ground as easily.
- It's not for the Bolsheviks, of any people, to accuse us of recalcitrance.

79
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,910
And the last.

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,520
Alexandrov from Ukraine has come over.

81
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,040
We would ask to let him speak at the opening.
- Alright.

82
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:33,540
The next question.

83
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,760
Please proceed.
- Comrades...

84
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,796
For two months already

85
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,080
the German imperialists, after
signing the Brest Peace,

86
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,380
came to Ukraine and toppled the Soviet rule there.

(speaking: A. P. Alexandrov, representative of the
underground Peasant Congress of Ukraine)

87
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,723
By now the bourgeoisie has regained the power

88
00:06:59,883 --> 00:07:02,940
that was taken from them by our October revolution.

89
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,723
The Germans are shooting the members of the land committees.

90
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,483
They are shooting rebel peasants.

91
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,470
They aren't sparing the elderly,

92
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,690
women or children.

93
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:18,390
There isn't a corner of Ukraine not plastered
with notices of the new executions.

94
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,990
Thousands have been shot dead.

95
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,820
Thousands are waiting for their turn.

96
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,090
This is what the Brest Peace has given to Ukraine.

97
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,350
Comrades!

98
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,890
But the Ukrainian toiling peasantry

99
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,300
and the Ukrainian proletariat are skilled in fighting!

100
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,060
And they are fighting their enemies!

101
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,170
Right now in Ukraine

102
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:44,220
in every governorate
rebellions are flaring up.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,960
The peasantry is rising up.

(note： Alexandrov is knowingly riling tension. Who is he? A left SR or their associate? Lenin.)

104
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,080
They are organizing troops.

(note： Alexandrov is knowingly riling tension. Who is he? A left SR or their associate? Lenin.)

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,786
And where possible,

(note： Alexandrov is knowingly riling tension. Who is he? A left SR or their associate? Lenin.)

106
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,433
they are driving Germans back.

107
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,120
The Ukrainians are fighting,

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,450
but, comrades,

109
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:58,930
they are outmatched.

110
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,743
Ukraine is bleeding out.

111
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,640
Speaking for our Congress,

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,563
we're addressing the All-Russian Congress

113
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,820
with a request for help.

114
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:13,480
Help us!

115
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,120
Comrade Lenin, support the Ukrainians!

116
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,280
Down with the Brest Peace!

117
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,480
I have no doubts

118
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,250
that in large part the ovation and applause

119
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,470
earned by the speaker

120
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,030
are addressing not his words,

121
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,830
but fully and explicitly

122
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,760
the fighting Ukrainian
workers and peasants.

123
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,920
Hail Ukraine!
Hail the Ukrainian workers and peasants!

124
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,980
On the matter of
the Brest Treaty,

125
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:21,430
I think that this question will be resolved

126
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,580
by the will of this Congress,

127
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,704
and not by some or other,

128
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,470
even the most sincere exclamations.

129
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,990
Announcing a twenty minute recess.

130
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,280
Understand, we are
powerless about this!

131
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,813
But what about the power
of the revolutionary ideas?

132
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,350
Does it count for nothing for you?

133
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,280
What war are you talking about,
when the people have nothing to eat?

134
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,096
There is no bread!
And where would the bread come from?

135
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,410
Germany is an adventure!
- And you're betting on a break! It's treason!

136
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,120
What about the Black Sea Fleet? Who sank it?

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,440
So what, should it have been surrendered to the Germans?

138
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
- We should have fought for it!
- With what?
- With your hands!

139
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,040
- Go fawn over von Mirbach, that provocateur and murderer!
- Traitors of the revolution!

140
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,440
- And you are talking about revolution?
- Where were you and your party in October?

141
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,240
- We were on the barricades!
- We haven't seen you there!
- Don't slander us, you liar!

142
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,600
- Don't slander us, you liar!
- Comrades, stop, have you gone mad?

143
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,280
- I fully agree with comrade Lenin!

144
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,370
Mister Sverdlov.

145
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,000
Can I distract you for a minute?

146
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,690
Calling to end the Brest Treaty,

147
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,240
the Left SRs are claiming that

148
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,480
it is them who truly represent the public
opinion of the Russian people.

149
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,600
What people?

150
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Workers, peasants?

151
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,530
The left SRs are affected by the public
bourgeois opinion, that much is true.

152
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,020
- I understand.
- The bourgeois public opinion.

153
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,540
They are interested in the public opinion of the kulaks,

154
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,420
who are dissatisfied with the Soviet
power not because of the Brest Treaty,

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,280
but because of our food security policy.

156
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
This is true as well.

157
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,312
But neither the said kulaks nor the peasants,

158
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,460
not to mention the working
class, nobody wants war.

159
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,220
and this is the actual truth.

160
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,570
Yes. One more question, Mr Sverdlov.

161
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,136
What do you think about Mariya Spiridonova?

162
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,890
As a leader of the Left SR party

163
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,960
and as a person.
- Excuse me.

164
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Comrade Sergeyev!

165
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,420
This is your department.

166
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Look into it.

167
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,680
As a party leader, I think

168
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,835
she can be fully characterized
by the same qualities

169
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,520
I proscribed to the whole party in general.

170
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,085
And as a person, unfortunately,

171
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,360
in political struggle one does not
think about that too often.

172
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,770
But she is certainly a courageous and
sincere person.

173
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,760
You must have known she shot at a tsar's general in 1906.
- 1906?

174
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,100
- Who was known by his cruelty.

175
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,090
Gendarmes...

176
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,420
Comrade Sablin!

177
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,240
I need you. One minute.

178
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,430
Gendarmes had outraged her abominably,

179
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,670
then prison, katorga,

180
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,010
our Rossiyan katorga,

181
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,350
she only had been freed by the February revolution.

182
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,073
Don't you think that
with a biography like that

183
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:58,410
it's her that could become
the nation's true leader?

184
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,170
I don't. Revolutionary biographies do not prevent

185
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,720
mistakes and political misconceptions.

186
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,280
Unfortunately, it's not some eternal capital.

187
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
Again the only supplies coming

188
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,870
will be oil cake and sunflower seeds.

189
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,996
And those two train cars won't solve anything anyway.

190
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,740
Vladimir Ilyich, the tensions in the theater are red hot.

191
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,910
Latsis and Kamkov have nearly come to blows in the foyer just
now, every minute now a real fight could happen.

192
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,370
Talk to Spiridonova, let
her placate her friends,

193
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,050
and I will ask Yakov Mikhaylovich
to cool down our faction.

194
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Vladimir Ilyich.

195
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,760
A telegram from Kaluga.

196
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,463
I will pass your request
to Yakov Mikhaylovich.
- Yes, yes.

197
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,590
Please learn how many mandates do we
have, and how many the Bolshevik faction does.
- Marya Alexandrovna!

198
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,323
This can't go on, I ask
you to talk with your people.

199
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,640
What happened?

200
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,800
There is a fight coming up.

201
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
What does that have to do with me?

202
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,610
It depends on your actions, not on me.

203
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,140
So there's how it is,

204
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,020
they are going to shower us with
curses and we must stay silent.

205
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,290
Why silent?

206
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,140
There are many means of polemics

207
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,460
somewhere in between silence and fighting.
- Stop all talking!

208
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,210
Attention!

209
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,600
Everybody look this way!

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,070
Attention.

211
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Shooting.

212
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
One. Two.

213
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,170
Three.

214
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,280
Four.

(sign: ...of the Soviets of the Worker, Peasant, Red Army and Cossack deputies)

215
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,270
Five.

(sign: ...of the Soviets of the Worker, Peasant, Red Army and Cossack deputies)

216
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,140
Six.

(sign: ...of the Soviets of the Worker, Peasant, Red Army and Cossack deputies)

217
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,130
Seven.

(sign: ...of the Soviets of the Worker, Peasant, Red Army and Cossack deputies)

218
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,130
Eight.

(sign: ...of the Soviets of the Worker, Peasant, Red Army and Cossack deputies)

219
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,540
Nine.

220
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Ten.

221
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,720
One more time. Nobody walk off.

222
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,780
Comrades, nobody walk off, one more time!

223
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,780
I don't recognize Lenin.

224
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
The Lenin of the October,

225
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
the fighting revolutionary leader of the masses,

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,480
who had one ideal,

227
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,090
one goal - the revolution!

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,000
And who is now calculating and accounting.

229
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,840
Who wants to deal amicably with the German imperialism

230
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,080
while hoping both
to keep his innocence

231
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,700
and acquire his capital.

232
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,050
I'm saying this with the greatest sorrow and grief.

233
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,050
I'm still closely tied to the Bolsheviks

234
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,840
after fighting side by side
on the same barricades

235
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,040
and willing to follow through our glorious way of struggle side by side.

(speaking: M. A. Spiridonova, the leader of the Socialist Revolutionary (Left) party)

236
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Comrades.

237
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,710
Comrades Bolsheviks.

238
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm asking you,

239
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,320
do you understand what's happening?

240
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,780
We are retreating after arduous battle

241
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,300
with a wounded comrade in our hands.

242
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,480
Will we really give him up to our enemy

243
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,710
to save our own lives
at the cost of his demise?

244
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,810
That is what

245
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,760
the Bolshevik government is doing now.

246
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,430
It is leaving for the hands of torturers

247
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
our freedom,

248
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
our ideals,

249
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,220
the revolution!

250
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,890
And demands from us to be silent witnesses
of the demise of our comrades!

251
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,970
Raiders have broken into our home!

252
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,350
They are killing our brothers,

253
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,750
raping our sisters,

254
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,690
and we are sitting in the room next door

255
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,840
afraid of moving so we don't get our share!

256
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,730
If this is the position of
the Soviet government,

257
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,540
then we, the party of left
revolutionary socialists,

258
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,030
are not going to go along
with this government.

259
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
Our revolution is a hearth,

260
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,360
and its sparks are
scattering everywhere

261
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,630
to inflame the great fire
of the world revolution!

262
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,560
Peoples of the world
are watching us with hope

263
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,520
and we must declare to the face
of our beaten brothers, Ukrainians,

264
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,900
to the face of our
downtrodden Finnish brothers,

265
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,010
to the face of the
toilers of the whole world

266
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,640
who are expecting of us to be fighting,

267
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,120
not drop to our knees!

268
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,380
Down

269
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,040
with the Brest Peace!

270
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,610
Down with all the talking of Brest!

271
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,650
Down with the opportunists!

272
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,530
Hail

273
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,660
to the fighting Ukraine!

274
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,510
Comrade Lenin, you have the floor.

275
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,070
Comrades,

276
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,220
allow me

277
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,400
despite the fact that the
previous orator's speech

278
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,650
was in places greatly agitated

279
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,680
to present you with my report,

280
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,230
speaking for the Council
of the People Commissars

281
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
as per usual,

282
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,520
touching upon the main principal questions

283
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,440
as they deserve.

284
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,080
I understand the anxiety,

285
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,420
the feelings that belied Mariya
Alexandrovna Spiridonova's speech.

286
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,470
She is a person whose
sincerity and devotion to her idea

287
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,510
can't be cast doubt on by any of us.

288
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
But in politics

289
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,700
one should have not only a flaming heart,

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
but also a sober,

291
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,050
cool head.

292
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,090
Or there will always be the danger

293
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,650
of getting fooled.

294
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,250
Comrades.

295
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,380
You know that since
the time of the last Congress

296
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
the main factor

297
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,890
defining our position,

298
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,210
having changed our tactics

299
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,850
and defined our politics

300
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,400
has been the Brest Peace.

301
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,070
Allow me to elaborate on this.

302
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,190
A war of many years

303
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,950
has left Russia's body in wounds.

304
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,080
Landlords, tsars and capitalists

305
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,250
left us with the inheritance
of greatest disrepair.

306
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,780
Our people today is like

307
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,310
a man beaten to within an inch of his life.

308
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,970
Our young republic,

309
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,670
having not yet been
able to stand on its feet,

310
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,800
must be involved in a
desperate, uneven fight.

311
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,500
Surrounded by a ring of
fire of counterrevolution,

312
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,370
mutiny,

313
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
blockade,

314
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,180
White Czechoslovakians' rebellion,

315
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,030
English and French in the north,

316
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,450
General Krasnov on the Don.

317
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:33,260
The country lacks bread.

318
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,750
In practice, we don't have any.

319
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,490
Add to this the epidemics of typhus,

320
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,190
cholera,

321
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:41,420
scurvy!

322
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,790
And finally, the eight German divisions

323
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,810
standing behind our backs
on the Orsha-Mogilev line,

324
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,310
ready to strike at us at a moment's notice

325
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,330
with all their power.

326
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,000
And in these conditions

327
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,710
there are still people

328
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,910
suggesting that we start a war with Germany

329
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,390
and break this

330
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,180
yes, an unjust one

331
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,560
and yes, a shameful one!

332
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,970
but vital to us

333
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,550
peace.

334
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,970
Claiming that our revolution

335
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,980
has got one dilemma only -

336
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
that it's either peace,

337
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,370
and consequently betrayal,

338
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,210
or a holy and noble revolutionary war,

339
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,560
our opponents are deliberately lying.

340
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,810
Because our dilemma is
a completely different one.

341
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,440
It's either a brutal,

342
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,450
demeaning peace,

343
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,530
or the demise of Soviet rule.

344
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,990
The most important question,

345
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,820
the final measure of every
revolution is one thing:

346
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,560
what has it given to the people?

347
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,270
We've had inscribed on our October banners

348
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,050
two words:

349
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:08,654
peace

350
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,974
and land.

351
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,634
But if we follow the left SRs today

352
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:16,364
then the land rights

353
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:18,024
for the peasants

354
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:22,514
whose interests are allegedly
represented by the left SRs

355
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:25,244
will turn for them into the rights

356
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:28,014
for the plots of their graves.

357
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:32,204
The Left SRs are claiming that they

358
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:35,420
are ready to go even with this.

359
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:42,580
Yes, we are retreating now.

360
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:45,194
It is a bitter,

361
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,367
demeaning truth.

362
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,720
But we don't have any other choice

363
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,633
because a war today,

364
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,572
and no one should have
any illusions about this,

365
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,812
means death for the Soviet rule.

366
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:05,604
The fate of the world revolution

367
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:09,543
is precious to us Bolsheviks no
less that they are to the left SRs.

368
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,984
Of course the people can be
cast into the fire of world revolution,

369
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,970
the fire that comrade
Spiridonova was talking about here.

370
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,513
But humans aren't firewood.

371
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:22,839
We have

372
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,573
a living child.

373
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:26,652
It is our

374
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:28,406
paid with blood

375
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,266
republic of the Soviets.

376
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,490
Peoples of the world are
trusting us with keeping

377
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:35,897
this child alive.

378
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:39,414
And we don't have, right now,

379
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:41,570
any holier purpose.

380
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,040
By the majority of the votes, the Congress accepts the resolution
of the Bolshevik faction endorsing the actions of the Sovnarkom.

381
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:01,637
July 6th 1918

382
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:06,577
The Central Committee of the Left Socialist Revolutionary
party has gathered for an emergency meeting.

383
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:10,960
To this end the CC of the party
considers permittable and worthwhile

384
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,067
to organize a series of acts of terror

385
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:17,603
upon the most notable representatives of the German imperialism.

386
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,283
At the same time

387
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,224
the party CC is ruling...

388
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,774
Comrades, I don't understand why
we are listening to all this!

389
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:26,487
We have very little time,

390
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:28,390
we all perfectly remember the CC's verdict.

391
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,683
You are absolutely wrong.

392
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:31,203
We're making a decision

393
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,640
that could decide entirely
the fate of our revolution.

394
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,613
We must analyze all this
very seriosly, without any hurry.

395
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,646
We need everyone to
decide on this themselves.

396
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,198
Mariya Alexandrovna is right, please continue Proshyan.

397
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:50,267
We are seeing our actions as a struggle against
the policy of the Council of People's Commissars

398
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:51,974
And not in any way

399
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:54,074
a struggle against the Bolsheviks.

400
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:55,824
However,

401
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,353
as the Bolsheviks might
perform acts of aggression

402
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,584
against our party,

403
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:02,924
the Central Committee is ruling

404
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:06,890
to commit in that case to armed defense

405
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,484
of the taken positions.

406
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,010
<i>Armed</i> defense.

407
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:15,370
Comrades, please speak.

408
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:18,104
I think the decision is clear.

409
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:19,444
I think so too.

410
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,137
Lenin is right on one point.

411
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:29,124
The situation in the contry
is indeed very difficult.

412
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:35,597
I'm afraid in these conditions our
proclamation might be taken the wrong way.

413
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,910
I don't understand,
what are you suggesting?

414
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,217
To agree with a betrayal?

415
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:41,564
What are you suggesting?

416
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,030
I am suggesting

417
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:46,504
to take another go at
influencing the Congress.

418
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:48,434
I am certain that

419
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:50,264
many of the delegates

420
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:52,037
are in truth wavering.

421
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:55,603
Let's try to turn the Congress
around one more time.

422
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,663
I...

423
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,150
I believe I agree with Kolegayev.

424
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:02,754
Me too.

425
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,764
Let us try.

426
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,344
Comrade Cherepanov,

427
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,036
report on our chances in the Congress.

428
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:13,216
So far

429
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:17,677
our every attempt to influence the
Bolsheviks in a democratic fashion failed.

430
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,370
The polling has shown

431
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:21,543
that tomorrow

432
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,524
in the voting session

433
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:26,024
we can only count on

434
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:27,314
400 votes,

435
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:31,004
while the Bolsheviks have 750 votes.

436
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:34,216
I don't pretend to know
what's on their minds,

437
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,149
but I think they will be voting
for their party's resolution.

438
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:38,244
Undoubtedly.

439
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,317
Any more questions?

440
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:47,136
Concluding.

441
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:49,316
Having ran out of possibilities

442
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,971
and not willing to allow the
fate of the world revolution

443
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:54,749
to be a plaything of the
whims of Russian democracy,

444
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:00,909
we are returning to our
decision made on June 24th.

445
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,527
There is no other way.

446
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,680
Please vote.

447
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:16,764
Unanimous.

448
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,519
Invite Blumkin.

449
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,137
Vyacheslav Nikolayevich,

450
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,730
is everything ready?

451
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:27,530
Oreshkin's militia

452
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:29,484
and the mounted VChK* troops are ready.

*All-Russian Extraordinary Commission

453
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:31,327
Do you mean Popov's troop?

454
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,169
Yes, Popov's troop, also Pingvinsky's
and the Pervomartovsky regiment.

455
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,734
You think this will suffice?

456
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,016
The people will support us.

457
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:39,883
The people are tired of war.

458
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:41,887
They will, should we be winning.

459
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:44,867
We are also counting on
the Latvian infantry regiment.

460
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:47,233
We should give extra
attention to the Latvian division.

461
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:48,261
Yes, very true.

462
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,024
We must send some
dependable comrades there.

463
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:53,493
We sent three men there.

464
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:54,533
Go yourself.

465
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:56,787
We must explain to the Latvian soldiers

466
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,634
that today the liberation of their homeland, Latvia,

467
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,264
depends only on themselves.

468
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,544
Go immediately.

469
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:13,374
The decision is made.

470
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,260
The party is sending you on this mission.

471
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,393
The Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionary party (left)

472
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:30,539
The chief of the Secret Department of VChK, Left SR Yakov Blumkin.

473
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,130
Malaya Lubyanka, 13. The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for
Combating Counter-Revolution, Sabotage and Profiteering (VChK).

474
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:16,946
Yes, yes.

475
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,526
Lyusen'ka, is Alexandrovich in his office?

476
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,447
- He is.
- Anything for me?

477
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:22,557
I don't think so. Here, some papers.

478
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,930
There will be, certainly.

479
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,089
Give me two blank Commission forms, please.

480
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:28,589
It's not for me.

481
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,344
Yes.

482
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:41,843
Hello.

483
00:27:47,200 --> 00:28:06,137
IDENTIFICATION.  The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission assigns its member Yakov Blumkin and
the Executive Tribunal representative Nikolay Andreyev to parlay with the German Ambassador...

484
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:27,834
Are you ready?

485
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:37,153
Sign it.

486
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,126
Prepare.

487
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,443
- Are the papers in order?
- Mmhm.

488
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,324
Comrade Sergeyev?

489
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:10,824
Alexandrovich here.

490
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,595
Prepare a car.

491
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,374
Well, godspeed.

492
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,587
I'll walk with you.

493
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:38,616
- Greetings, Felix Edmundovich.
- Good afternoon.

494
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,403
I was just meaning to come by your office.

495
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,295
I'll catch up.

496
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:42,882
Yenukidze called again.

497
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:44,274
Here's his letter.

498
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:47,700
- Let's meet in an hour and think how we can help.
- Alright.

499
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:50,793
- And Vyacheslav Nikolayevich?
- Yes?
- Please restrain Kochetov.

500
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:53,639
His men were shooting through the whole city again.
- They're learning.

501
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,819
- Let them learn somewhere else,
they are scaring the entire Moscow.

502
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,167
A mansion in the Denezhny alley.
The German embassy.

503
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,760
I need to meet someone from the embassy.

504
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,573
No one is in right now.

505
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:30,399
They're dining.

506
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:32,208
You can wait inside.

507
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:05,456
"We had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes".

(from the testimony of Yakov Blumkin)

508
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,990
What do you want, sirs?

509
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:39,782
We are representatives of the
All-Russian Extraordinary Commission.

510
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:41,272
Here's our papers.

511
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:45,015
We need to meet with Mr ambassador.

512
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,595
Ein moment, bitte.

513
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,373
Sirs, Mr Rietzler.

514
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:30,004
- Are you from Mr Dzerzhinsky?
- Yes.

515
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:34,091
Mr advisor is listening.

516
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,790
I am the chief of the Secret
Department of the VChK.

517
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,782
Andreyev, representative
of the Revolutionary Tribunal.

518
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:46,121
We were assigned to discuss a
personal matter with Mr ambassador.

519
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:57,130
Mr advisor is permitted by Mr
ambassador to speak on any matter.

520
00:32:57,452 --> 00:33:00,205
It concerns the nephew of Mr ambassador,

521
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,612
count Robert Mirbach,

522
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,764
arrested by the VChK
on suspicion of espionage.

523
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,465
Our instructions only permit us to
dicuss it with Mr ambassador in person.

524
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:23,143
Mr advisor shall inform Mr ambassador.

525
00:33:32,523 --> 00:33:33,592
Please.

526
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,970
Sit, please.

527
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:15,775
Greetings, sirs.

528
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:17,161
Please sit.

529
00:34:17,412 --> 00:34:19,328
- Obliged.
- How can I help you?

530
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:22,918
Mr ambassador, the matter
concerns your family member.

531
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,392
Count Robert Mirbach, your nephew.

532
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:29,465
I am very sorry, but among my relations

533
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:32,184
there is no man bearing that name.

534
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,745
Possibly this is some misunderstanding.

535
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:39,358
The arrested insists he is a descendant
of the Hungarian line of your family.

536
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:42,845
Count Robert Mirbach is being
accused of espionage for Germany.

537
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:45,258
You can peruse the papers.

538
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:06,358
Please sit, sirs.

539
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:12,412
Nein.

540
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:23,503
This is a very serious matter, the
tribunal will be assembled in a few days.

541
00:35:33,323 --> 00:35:36,623
I believe we can offer an answer to this

542
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:40,145
through Mr people's commissar Chicherin.

543
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:49,905
Well sirs, this is
everything we can do now.

544
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:55,345
Perhaps Mr ambassador is
interested in the extent of the actions

545
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:58,245
to be taken concerning the
case of count Robert Mirbach?

546
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,623
"Both myself and Dr Rietzler dropped to the floor on instinct".

(from the testimony of Lt Mueller)

547
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:44,116
14:47

548
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:48,416
At the Congress, a recess
was announced at 15:00.

549
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:14,630
The Kremlin. 15:25

550
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:16,772
...they want a first
class train car...

551
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,305
..and he got sour.

552
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,645
- Something urgent?
- A telegram.

553
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:26,472
Put it on my desk,
I'll be back soon.

554
00:37:30,638 --> 00:37:31,798
- Good afternoon!
- Greetings.

555
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:32,902
Please make sure of it.

556
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:34,001
I will.

557
00:37:34,028 --> 00:37:36,734
You sure you don't want to come in?
- I can't.

558
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:37,822
Alright, done.

559
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:24,802
Vladimir Ilyich.

560
00:38:25,332 --> 00:38:26,585
Mirbach has been assassinated.

561
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,922
A bomb went off at
the German embassy.

562
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:31,672
Chicherin called.

563
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,087
The killers are on the run.

564
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,142
We know nothing else.

565
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,123
Monarchists, White Guard?

566
00:38:48,462 --> 00:38:49,462
Unclear for now.

567
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,868
We're being dragged into
the war by any means possible.

568
00:38:58,194 --> 00:38:59,572
Vladimir Dmitriyevich.

569
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,140
Find Sverdlov immediately.

570
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,221
Inform all the people's
commissars and CC members.

571
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:07,107
And go to the embassy,
see what's happening there.

572
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:10,918
And call Sklyansky.
- Good, right.

573
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:33,622
I need Dzerzhinsky.

574
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:37,465
Felix Edmundovich.

575
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:40,118
Do you know Mirbach has
just been killed with a bomb?

576
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:44,864
I'm asking you to
investigate this immediately.

577
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:46,492
Immediately!

578
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:48,265
Call me, I'm at my office.

579
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,882
Comrade Gorbunov, come with me.

580
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:08,512
Call for Chicherin.

581
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:12,058
Mirbach's been assassinated.

582
00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:13,535
Write down the telephonogram.

583
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,118
Yelena Sergeyevna.

584
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:17,401
Come by please.

585
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:20,444
To all RKP* district committees.

<i>* Workers and Peasants Party</i>

586
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:22,451
To all district sovdeps*.

<i>* Soviets of Deputies</i>

587
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:25,011
To all Red Army command staff.

588
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:28,398
Today around three o'clock afternoon...

589
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:30,128
With a bomb...

590
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:31,718
One minute.

591
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,224
Mirbach was assassinated
at the German embassy.

592
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:37,224
Listening.

593
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:39,631
Nothing's clear yet.

594
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:41,498
Alright.

595
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:44,154
It was certainly done by either monarchists

596
00:40:44,374 --> 00:40:48,981
or those provocateurs...
- Chicherin is coming.
- ...who want to drag Russia into a war...

597
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:52,018
...in the interests of the
Anglo-French imperialists...

598
00:40:52,474 --> 00:40:53,474
Can't keep up.

599
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:55,118
Sorry.

600
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,091
...in the interests of the
Anglo-French imperialists...

601
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:01,023
...after having
Czechoslovakians bribed.

602
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:04,163
After having
Czechoslovakians bribed.

603
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:06,657
Yes? Alright.

604
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:08,164
Some incident...

605
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,524
Mobilize every asset,

606
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,864
call in everyone immediately
to apprehend the perpetrators.

607
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,950
Well, can't complain about
monotonous life so far.

608
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:19,523
True. Give this to
Churikov, I've signed it.

609
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,030
Stop every car.

610
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:26,391
And detain them until triple checked.

611
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:29,037
Triple checked.

612
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:30,898
The Sovnarkom's Chariman

613
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,296
Ulyanov-Lenin.

614
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,514
Send urgenty.
- Vladimir Ilyich, I'm going.

615
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:39,618
Go, Vladimir Dmitriyevich, do everything to protect the
Germans from any further possible endangerment.

616
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:40,778
Listening.

617
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,428
It's Dzerzhinsky.

618
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:45,998
What do you mean?

619
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:49,644
By certain appearances,
this was a Left SR action.

620
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:52,358
What papers?

621
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:55,698
They presented some
kind of an official mandate.

622
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,270
Well, it's getting worse.

623
00:41:57,744 --> 00:41:58,971
Who was it exactly?

624
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:03,104
On their own or with the CC in the know?

625
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:05,777
This is extremely important.

626
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:09,308
Clarify.

627
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:12,082
Alright.

628
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,208
I'm waiting.

629
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:15,355
Even if the CC didn't know,

630
00:42:15,654 --> 00:42:18,320
it would be a result of the hysteria
they promoted at the Congress.

631
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,447
Madness.

632
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,370
Witness another monstrous swaying* of the petit-bourgeois...

*wordplay, Lenin's using an incorrect <i>kolebnutie</i> in reference to the German <i>Kleinburger</i>

633
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,114
That's what Engels said on this:

634
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,234
the frenzied petit-bourgeouis.

635
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:29,234
Der rabiat gewordene Kleinburger.

636
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,448
Invite Gorbunov, please.

637
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,198
Kleinburger...

638
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,049
Georgiy Vasilyevich*.

<i>* Chicherin</i>

639
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:38,036
We must influence the upcoming German
report to Berlin in any way possible.

640
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:40,758
There is more than enough
cause for military intervention.

641
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:44,608
Especially considering the killers had
a Soviet state mandate on their hands.

642
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:45,758
Meaning?

643
00:42:46,048 --> 00:42:48,127
They presented some official papers.

644
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,188
Deft!

645
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:03,534
For the Germans that means we are
directly involved in the assassination.

646
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,738
We must send an
urgent telegram to Berlin.

647
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:11,084
Let Ioffe offer apologies and condolences

648
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:12,644
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

649
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,644
We must do everything possible to prevent
the Germans from using this adventure.

650
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:19,056
They will should they want it. Their
troops are stationed too close to Moscow.

651
00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:22,961
I have left a letter here... Vladimir Ilyich, have you seen it?
- No, no... I haven't.

652
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:24,188
Listening.

653
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:27,281
No, the meeting must begin as scheduled。

654
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:29,767
- Yes, listening.
- Yes, at six exactly.

655
00:43:29,938 --> 00:43:32,573
No. All car passes are now void.

656
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,271
- Listening.
- The only valid signatures are mine and Lenin's.

657
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:38,874
- One minute. Well?
- We must go to the embassy to express our condolences.

658
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:43,542
Go then, Georgiy Vasilyevich.

659
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:45,415
What can we do.

660
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:47,888
No, Vladimir Ilyich.

661
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:49,641
If someone should go,

662
00:43:50,688 --> 00:43:51,728
it must be you.

663
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:55,301
Also Yakov Mikhaylovich and me.

664
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:03,854
On this question, call Shibayev.

665
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:25,914
What do they say in situations like this?

666
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,671
Vladimir Ilyich, the VChK
subordinate Blumkin did the shooting.

667
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:05,744
Do the Germans know this?

668
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:07,931
He presented these papers.

669
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:12,951
Your signature is on them.
- The signatues, mine and Ksenofontov's, are forged.

670
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,850
And VChK's seal on
this, is it forged as well?

671
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:19,133
Felix Edmundovich, Trepalov called.

672
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:22,444
Blumkin's with the Popov's detachment.
Popov is refusing to give him up.

673
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,390
Does he know that this is an
order of the VChK's chairman?

674
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:27,477
Trepalov says he has
almost been arrested himself.

675
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:30,708
- I'm going there.
- Absolutely not! This will only jeopardize...

676
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:32,927
- Nonsense. If Felix goes, everything will be fine.

677
00:45:32,974 --> 00:45:35,847
- I don't know. I think Vladimir Dmitriyevich
is right. Better to send in some troops.

678
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:38,107
Still, I'm accountable for the VchK
before the party, Vladimir Ilyich.

679
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,438
Alright, go.

680
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:22,194
The address of the Soviet government shall be recited by the Chairman
of the Council of People's Commissars, Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin.

681
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:28,829
Mr advisor has said that he will tell...

682
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:32,675
We understand perfectly.

683
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:44,864
Well. Next time, the ones who do the
shooting should be the ones to go apologize.

684
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:50,708
To the Kremlin.

685
00:47:55,766 --> 00:48:01,639
Vikula Morozov's mansion. VChK mounted unit (Popov's detachment). 16:50

686
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,970
banner: Hail World Revolution

687
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:16,829
- Greetings, comrade Dzerzhinsky!
- Greetings, Felix Edmundovich.
- Greetings.

688
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:20,795
- Greetings, Felix Edmundovich.
- What's the celebration is about?

689
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:22,801
- Mirbach has been killed.
- So what?

690
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:24,998
- You understand, it's serious business.

691
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,038
Hello, Lyalin, where is Popov?

692
00:48:31,063 --> 00:48:32,591
At the headquarters, should I call for him?

693
00:48:32,638 --> 00:48:33,638
Don't.

694
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:42,354
Greetings. Call Popov to me.

695
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:47,887
VChK command office.

696
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:52,087
This is Dzerzhinsky. Call
Alexandrovich, please.

697
00:48:53,627 --> 00:48:56,168
When he turns up, tell
him to call me immediately.

698
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,368
I'm at Popov's.

699
00:48:58,388 --> 00:49:00,388
- Greetings, Felix Edmundovich...
- Where's Blumkin?

700
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:01,758
- I don't know, Felix Edmundovich.

701
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:04,264
He's been here, comrade
Belenky here has spoken to him.

702
00:49:04,297 --> 00:49:06,290
He was ill, something wrong with his leg.
- And?

703
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,557
- He took a cab and went for a hospital.

704
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:11,104
- Has anyone seen him going?
- I have.

705
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:13,118
- When was it?
- At three or maybe four.

706
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:14,578
- Who was on guard duty at that time?

707
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:16,494
- Tkachenko and Shpunker.
- Call for them.

708
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,474
- Their shift has ended,
they went off somewhere.

709
00:49:24,388 --> 00:49:28,214
Give me your word of a revolutionary
that you don't know where Blumkin is.

710
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:31,961
I'm giving you my word, Felix Edmundovich,
that I indeed don't know if he's here.

711
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:34,231
Before lying, Popov,

712
00:49:34,758 --> 00:49:36,158
you should learn to lie.

713
00:49:36,857 --> 00:49:39,243
Give up your weapon and follow me.

714
00:49:56,768 --> 00:49:57,974
Have you been here long?

715
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:00,128
Don't understand.

716
00:50:00,387 --> 00:50:03,473
Those are Finns, Felix Edmundovich,
they don't understand Russian that well.

717
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:06,193
Have they seen any strangers here?

718
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:17,011
Felix Edmundovich,
they're saying they've seen

719
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:19,167
a person not belonging to the detachment.

720
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:20,301
Tall, dark hair,

721
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:21,834
they were helping him walk.

722
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:24,574
Thank you comrades.

723
00:50:31,704 --> 00:50:33,364
- What should we do?
- Who the hell knows.

724
00:50:33,857 --> 00:50:34,984
Wait for me here.

725
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:48,119
So?

726
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:50,370
He's arrested Popov,
and is looking for Blumkin.

727
00:50:55,854 --> 00:50:57,440
We should just tell him the truth.

728
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,453
- He's a revolutionary, he'll understand us.
- What does it matter if he knows now or in an hour at the Congress?

729
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:03,813
You are all mad. He will
arrest us at the spot.

730
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,273
Dzerzhinsky will not dare, he will be obliged
to bring the question before the Congress.

731
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,664
You don't know Dzerzhinsky.

732
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,613
He'll arrest everybody, and immediately.

733
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,546
Yes, and unfortunately he will
have every legal right to do so.

734
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,557
Any of us would do the same in his place.

735
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:20,997
Well.

736
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:26,750
In this case we will have
to arrest Dzerzhinsky.

737
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:29,400
We don't have any other choice.

738
00:51:30,774 --> 00:51:32,707
Yes, unfortunately it's unavoidable.

739
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,567
Then the sooner we do it the better.

740
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,004
I agree.

741
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:46,264
There's no one in there.

742
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:47,524
Who's got the key?

743
00:51:47,574 --> 00:51:49,880
- The door is sealed, Felix Edmundovich.
- Break it down.

744
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:52,420
- I give you my word there's...
- Break it down!

745
00:51:56,433 --> 00:52:02,590
"At this time I was in the detachment's hospital across the street".

(from the Yakov Blumkin's testimony)

746
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:18,814
You're searching in vain.

747
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:22,760
Blumkin killed Mirbach
by decree of our party's CC,

748
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:24,727
and we will not give him up.

749
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:30,207
On behalf of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission,

750
00:52:30,924 --> 00:52:32,737
I place you under arrest.

751
00:52:33,264 --> 00:52:34,507
Follow me to my car.

752
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:36,014
Alright, we will comply.

753
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,264
But we must inform the Cenrtal
Committee of our party of the arrest.

754
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:51,423
I can't let you in, Felix Edmundovich.

755
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:56,649
What's happening in this unit?

756
00:52:57,954 --> 00:53:00,600
You've gone insane, all of you!

757
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:12,654
Felix Edmundovich.

758
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:17,240
On behalf of the Central Committee
of our party, I place you under arrest.

759
00:53:18,204 --> 00:53:19,870
And demand you
turn in your weapons.

760
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:29,420
Give up your weapons, Felix Edmundovich.

761
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,024
Well then, comrades.

762
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,317
Will you really allow some mister

763
00:53:40,737 --> 00:53:43,863
to disarm the VChK chairman on your watch?

764
00:53:45,114 --> 00:53:48,514
Do you not understand that this is a
declaration of war on the Soviet rule?

765
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:50,674
Comrades!

766
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:56,030
- I demand you help me to arrest this gang of traitors...
- Stop your agitation!

767
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,136
It's a done deal.

768
00:53:58,410 --> 00:53:59,863
The Brest Peace has been breached.

769
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,669
The war on Germany is unavoidable now!

770
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,790
The robbery you were
assisting has come to its end!

771
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:06,035
The Brest Peace has been
approved by the Soviets Congress.

772
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:08,162
And attempting to violate it is treason!

773
00:54:08,187 --> 00:54:11,242
The Brest Peace is a
capitulation of our entire project!

774
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,500
This is betrayal of the
revolutionary cause.

775
00:54:13,527 --> 00:54:15,294
It's your own words, comrade Dzerzhinsky!

776
00:54:15,826 --> 00:54:19,379
- We all remember this very well.
- It was a mistake we paid dearly for!

777
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:21,279
- And which you
are still committed to making,

778
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:22,546
not seeing where it will lead!

779
00:54:22,571 --> 00:54:24,694
- To the holy revolutionary war!

780
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:28,363
- To the White Guard* rule, and betrayal!
- And surrendering to the imperialists...

<i>* royalist restoration forces</i>

781
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,184
Ukraine,

782
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:32,153
Estland*,

<i>* Northern Estonia</i>

783
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,263
Lithuania,

784
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:35,754
surrendering millions of
our brothers to be massacred,

785
00:54:37,017 --> 00:54:38,530
is this not betrayal?

786
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,950
Disarm him.

787
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,088
It's alright, Felix Edmundovich.

788
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:49,775
You had your October.

789
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:52,274
We'll have our July.
- Your entire mutiny

790
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:54,994
will be crushed within a day.

791
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:57,513
We will keep you as a hostage

792
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,384
to ensure our comrades'
safety at the Congress.

793
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,366
Take away the arrested.

794
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,824
Let's go, comrades.

795
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:11,077
So you are going?

796
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:16,444
The Congress should
hear it from us in person.

797
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:23,863
Mariya Aleksandrovna.

798
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,037
The lads are worried.

799
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:26,890
After all it's Dzerzhinsky.

800
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:29,110
Someone should
explain it all to them.

801
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:31,534
Alright.

802
00:55:32,064 --> 00:55:33,124
I'll speak to them.

803
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,250
Fyodor!

804
00:55:37,884 --> 00:55:38,884
Get your people.

805
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:41,224
Send out a guard dispatch, prepare the
armored cars. Everyone else, to the meeting.

806
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,250
- Can't do with the armor. We're out of fuel.

807
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,864
Well, find some.

808
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:48,350
The Kremlin.

17:10

809
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:56,254
What's with Berlin?

810
00:55:56,514 --> 00:55:57,514
Silent.

811
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:00,184
Go ahead.

812
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:05,107
I've read it, I agree completely.

813
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:08,314
- So how did it go, Vladimir Ilyich?
- Nothing good so far. We have to go to the Congress.

814
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:10,926
Is the letter ready for a signature? Let me have it.

815
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:13,913
Please type a few words, I will dictate.

816
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,774
To Omsk.

817
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,299
To predsovdepa* Turchansky.

<i>* Chairman of the Soviet of Deputies</i>

818
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:26,974
This is another urgent one.

819
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:31,133
Has Dzerzhinsky called?

820
00:56:34,113 --> 00:56:35,153
Let's go.

821
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:57,079
You know, I'm signing this.

822
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,264
Calling Turov.

823
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:00,274
No, Sverdlov.

824
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:02,374
Comrade Turov?

825
00:57:02,484 --> 00:57:03,564
We're ready to go.

826
00:57:05,937 --> 00:57:08,043
This all will wait, let's
go comrades, let's go.

827
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,897
We must start the meeting on time.

828
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,014
Vladimir Ilyich!

829
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,686
Someone's asking
for you on a direct line.

830
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:13,560
Berlin?

831
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:14,677
Yaroslavl.

832
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:19,464
Yaroslavl has been taken by the Union for
the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom

833
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:32,097
led by Savinkov. Comrade Nakhimson has been
shot, all members of the Soviet massacred,

834
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:46,310
109 of local party administration staff drowned
in the Volga. Requesting military assistance.

835
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:48,340
Bastards.

836
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:50,674
What bastards.

837
00:57:51,214 --> 00:57:52,294
Call the narkomvoen*!

* People's Commissar of Military Affairs

838
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,007
I'm going to the Congress now.

839
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:00,797
Go, Yakov Mikhaylovich.

840
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,131
The narkomvoen is on the line.

841
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:03,690
Call me at the break.

842
00:58:09,717 --> 00:58:10,723
Greetings.

843
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:14,600
What has been done to
quell the Yaroslavl mutiny?

844
00:58:16,464 --> 00:58:17,464
When?

845
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:21,414
Semyonov's reporting the details.

846
00:58:21,594 --> 00:58:23,400
The entire Soviet
has been massacred.

847
00:58:24,596 --> 00:58:25,956
Nakhimson's shot.

848
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:29,094
109 people have been drowned in the Volga.

849
00:58:31,164 --> 00:58:34,244
I don't want to assume your
staff will be slow to respond,

850
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:38,120
but I'm asking you to oversee
this personally however possible.

851
00:58:38,814 --> 00:58:40,380
Pull together all forces.

852
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,114
Everything you can and can not.

853
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:44,804
Give me hourly reports

854
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,520
considering this matter.

855
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:50,720
We went to the embassy, apologized.

856
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,630
Berlin is keeping silent so far.

857
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:57,029
- The ways and the agenda of our party are direct and clear!

Popov's detachment

17:20

858
00:58:58,088 --> 00:59:01,408
Through complete denial of any concessions,

859
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:04,644
through class struggle against landlords

860
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,180
and capitalists,

861
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:11,187
through rebellion and revolutionary
war against the world bourgeoisie

862
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,447
to the full victory over war,

863
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:17,087
exploitation,

864
00:59:17,613 --> 00:59:19,933
to the socialist conquest
of the whole world.

865
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:23,866
We don't want our
brothers' blood to be spilled.

866
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:27,879
We are calling upon our
Bolshevik brothers to come with us

867
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:30,565
along the path of the socialist revolution!

868
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:33,270
We are heading to the Congress

869
00:59:33,594 --> 00:59:36,257
to pronounce before all the toilers,

870
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,160
and to the face of the world imperialism,

871
00:59:39,306 --> 00:59:41,200
our position.

872
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,434
We believe that the Congress delegates

873
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:48,247
will understand and support us as one!

874
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:51,274
Hail Soviet rule!

875
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,327
Deadly and merciless war

876
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:57,384
to the world imperialism!

877
00:59:57,663 --> 01:00:01,786
Ura, comrades!
- Ura!

878
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:06,150
Moscow was still unaware.

879
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:18,957
Stop!

880
01:00:20,911 --> 01:00:22,624
What happened, comrade?

881
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,152
Whose car is this?

882
01:00:24,682 --> 01:00:25,682
I am a Congress delegate.

883
01:00:27,142 --> 01:00:27,808
Here.

884
01:00:28,522 --> 01:00:29,522
Here is my mandate.

885
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:30,752
What happened?

886
01:00:31,852 --> 01:00:33,262
Well listen here, comrade delegate,

887
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:35,242
get out of the car quick

888
01:00:35,572 --> 01:00:37,222
and move it fast, you understand?

889
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:40,072
Don't you understand Russian?

890
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,202
Kuzmenko, explain to the comrade.

891
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:44,852
Comrades, comrades, this is some sort of a misunderstanding.

892
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:46,642
I am a Congress delegate, you understand?

893
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:47,762
You've been told to get out,

894
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:49,232
so get out.

895
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:50,722
Comrades, this is some sort of misunderstanding.

896
01:00:51,262 --> 01:00:53,542
I will be filing a complaint...
- Listen, bro.

897
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:55,112
Got a lot of gas?

898
01:00:55,312 --> 01:00:58,883
There is some.
- It's being requisited for the Left SR party. Got it?

899
01:00:58,942 --> 01:01:00,832
Comrades, this is some sort of misunderstanding. Comrades!

900
01:01:01,582 --> 01:01:03,382
I am the delegate of the Kovrov soviet.

901
01:01:03,562 --> 01:01:07,522
My surname is Abelman. I am a Congress delegate, understand?
They are waiting for me. Check my papers and please...

902
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
The Kremlin. 17:50

903
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,327
What?

904
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:22,352
Who reported this?

905
01:01:22,732 --> 01:01:23,732
Khrustalyov, a VChK man.

906
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:25,492
He went with Dzerzhinsky to the Apropos hotel.

907
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:27,564
He was able to get out of there.

908
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:33,022
Immediately contact the Left SRs central committee and learn if they know about this.

909
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:35,842
Dzerzhinsky has been arrested <i>by</i> the Left SRs central committee.

910
01:01:37,218 --> 01:01:37,642
Everyone was there.

911
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:39,712
Proshyan, and Spiridonova, and Kolegayev.

912
01:01:40,695 --> 01:01:42,895
They moved their residence to Popov's headquarters.

913
01:01:53,737 --> 01:01:54,757
Well.

914
01:01:58,375 --> 01:01:59,662
Open rebellion.

915
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:02,991
Mutiny.

916
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,402
Attempt at a palace coup.

917
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:35,152
Call Podvoysky and Muralov and tell them they are
appointed operational leaders

918
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,922
for counter-insurgency.

919
01:02:41,043 --> 01:02:43,596
For Felix's life the rebels will answer with their heads.

920
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:45,636
Let them know this.

921
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,703
While Dzerzhinsky is absent the acting VchK head will be Latsis.

922
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:02,818
About the Left SR faction...

923
01:03:06,572 --> 01:03:09,785
With the arrest of a member of the government
they outlawed themselves.

924
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:14,082
At the congress, the Left SR faction

925
01:03:15,436 --> 01:03:16,609
is to be arrested.

926
01:03:19,356 --> 01:03:20,656
Tell Sverdlov.

927
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:23,516
Bolshoi Theatre. 18:20

928
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,475
Sergey Petrovich!

929
01:03:58,015 --> 01:03:59,082
Comrade Stepanov!

930
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:29,717
Hello.

931
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:34,056
Yakov Mikhailovich?
- Yes?

932
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:39,712
On behalf of our faction we would like to ask
to have the floor for an extraordinary statement.

933
01:04:40,192 --> 01:04:41,192
Alright.

934
01:04:41,236 --> 01:04:43,323
Marya Aleksandrovna, I will stay here.
- Good.

935
01:04:55,136 --> 01:04:56,430
Lenin's still not here?

936
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:57,942
Not yet.

937
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:05,672
Well, comrades.

938
01:05:06,161 --> 01:05:07,232
Let's begin.

939
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:09,182
We've got the quorum.

940
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:11,807
I ask presidium members
to take the stage.

941
01:05:12,401 --> 01:05:14,087
And delegates to take their seats.

942
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:22,201
Dzerzhinsky has been arrested by the Left
SR central committee. What do we do? Peters.

943
01:05:23,534 --> 01:05:24,834
Watch Sverdlov.

944
01:05:35,836 --> 01:05:36,872
Comrades!

945
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:39,856
The Congress presidium just got a note.

946
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:43,469
The Bolshevik faction

947
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:47,068
is asking before the work starts

948
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:50,588
for a small ten minute meeting.

949
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:53,614
I don't think this should raise any strong objections.

950
01:05:56,374 --> 01:05:58,942
The faction is asking Bolshevik Congress delegates

951
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:01,513
and the guests of the Bolshevik faction members

952
01:06:02,198 --> 01:06:04,284
to proceed to the opposite side of the street,
to the Second House of Soviets.

953
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:06,324
In fifteen to twenty minutes

954
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:08,011
the Congress will reconvene.

955
01:06:20,196 --> 01:06:21,272
Viktor Aleksandrovich!

956
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,428
Always with the surprises, Yakov Mikhailovich.

957
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:27,175
What to do, Marya Aleksandrovna.

958
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:30,428
Our entire life consists of suprises, big or small.

959
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:33,092
Learn what's happening there.

960
01:06:44,283 --> 01:06:46,243
Immediately block all exits and entrances.

961
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:50,512
Nobody is to be let out until further notice.
Everybody must be at their seats.

962
01:06:50,856 --> 01:06:52,176
Tell our delegates

963
01:06:52,522 --> 01:06:54,155
to gather at Malaya Dmitrovka street.

964
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:59,322
Nikolay Dmitriyevich!
- Yes?

965
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:00,662
Wait for me.

966
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:03,661
Malaya Dmitrovka?
- Malaya Dmitrovka.

967
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,894
Yakov Mikhailovich.

968
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:08,471
Excuse us.

969
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:12,045
Vladimir Ilyich

970
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:13,112
is sending this.

971
01:07:13,225 --> 01:07:14,425
The Left SR faction

972
01:07:14,692 --> 01:07:15,782
is to be arrested.

973
01:07:16,011 --> 01:07:17,018
Already done.

974
01:07:31,835 --> 01:07:33,155
You can't go on the stage.

975
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:35,341
Why is that?

976
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,020
Orders of comrade Latsis.

977
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,167
This is becoming ridiculous.

978
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,580
What if we want to smoke, not
to mention something else?

979
01:07:43,752 --> 01:07:44,715
What happened?

980
01:07:44,842 --> 01:07:45,875
Smoke here.

981
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:50,462
Interesting.

982
01:07:51,642 --> 01:07:54,122
What's happening?
- Nobody knows anything.

983
01:07:55,975 --> 01:07:57,062
We have to know.

984
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,335
What's happening, comrades?
- Guards aren't letting anybody out.

985
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:02,087
Comrades, orders of comrade Latsis!

986
01:08:02,348 --> 01:08:03,494
What orders?

987
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:05,787
We have orders!
- What is happening there?

988
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:07,594
Marya Aleksandrovna, I think
we've just been arrested.

989
01:08:08,394 --> 01:08:10,154
In any case they aren't letting us out.

990
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:23,183
Calm down, comrades!

991
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:25,003
We have been hypocritically deceived!

992
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:27,812
And deception has never
been a sign of strength!

993
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:30,752
I call for you to keep revolutionary calm!

994
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:35,402
Stay cool, comrades.

995
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:39,922
Citizens SRs,

996
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,822
you all shall remain here

997
01:08:47,812 --> 01:08:50,803
until further orders from the
Council of People's Commissars.

998
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:56,345
Popov's troops. 19:40

999
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:15,676
Marya Aleksandrovna

1000
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:17,835
along with the whole faction
has been arrested by Peters.

1001
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:20,042
Okay, do it. We're waiting.

1002
01:09:20,182 --> 01:09:21,275
Bolshoi Theatre

1003
01:09:21,362 --> 01:09:22,412
is surrounded.

1004
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:23,988
I barely made it out.

1005
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,412
Wait a minute.
- I don't know anything more.

1006
01:09:32,741 --> 01:09:33,782
Well then.

1007
01:09:34,334 --> 01:09:35,812
At least it's clear now.

1008
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,060
There they go, your beloved Bolsheviks.
- Mine?! - Well it's your blunder.

1009
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:41,905
You dreamed of merging the parties with them.

1010
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:45,932
Arresting people's elected delegates! Even
the tsarist government didn't stoop to this.

1011
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:49,096
We must free our comrades with weapons in our arms.

1012
01:09:50,722 --> 01:09:52,402
We must do it immediately. And...

1013
01:09:52,762 --> 01:09:54,292
Before all.
- Before all:

1014
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:55,412
The telegraph.

1015
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,268
The telephone.

1016
01:09:56,512 --> 01:09:58,345
Power plants, rail stations, bridges.

1017
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:00,818
Do you want to leave Spiridonova in their hands?

1018
01:10:00,918 --> 01:10:05,120
For Mariya Aleksandrovna, I will not only level the Bolshoi,
I'll level half the Kremlin and Lubyanka as well!

1019
01:10:05,338 --> 01:10:06,772
Can you give me a small strike force?

1020
01:10:06,892 --> 01:10:08,525
I'll take a hundred men and an armored car.

1021
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,478
We'll hit them from the metropoly's side and blow all their...

1022
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:11,962
Guard.
- I'm going with you.

1023
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:12,711
And I.

1024
01:10:13,012 --> 01:10:14,182
Comrades, but this is...

1025
01:10:14,338 --> 01:10:16,972
Fratricide!
- Yes, and what do you suggest?

1026
01:10:17,482 --> 01:10:20,432
It's always the same question and the same answer.

1027
01:10:21,035 --> 01:10:22,468
"We've got no other choice".

1028
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:27,776
I get Popov with revolutionary winds
in his head, but you, Proshyan?

1029
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,714
They are our comrades who made
the revolution happen alongside us.

1030
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:34,327
Split bread and salt.

1031
01:10:35,547 --> 01:10:36,570
You.

1032
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,220
Will you shoot

1033
01:10:38,686 --> 01:10:39,720
at Peters?

1034
01:10:40,732 --> 01:10:42,112
Lenin? Sverdlov?

1035
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,470
Why are you silent?

1036
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,810
"No other choice" you say?

1037
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:16,877
21:10. SRs took the telegraph.
(the rebellion chronicle)

1038
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:21,990
Part of the Moscow garrison switched to the SR side.
They were also joined by...

1039
01:11:22,675 --> 01:11:24,116
the VChK cavalry detachment.

1040
01:11:24,862 --> 01:11:26,690
Kolchanov's artillery division...

1041
01:11:26,868 --> 01:11:29,654
Right now I'm only interested in those who stayed.

1042
01:11:30,628 --> 01:11:31,710
Vladimir Ilyich.

1043
01:11:32,107 --> 01:11:33,754
All the best have been sent to the frontlines.

1044
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,130
Besides, there's Yaroslavl.

1045
01:11:35,936 --> 01:11:37,883
We're left with only the Kremlin regiment,

1046
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,970
infantry school cadets and the division

1047
01:11:41,222 --> 01:11:43,280
of Latvian Riflemen. But they aren't in the city.

1048
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,230
Why isn't the Latvian division in Moscow?

1049
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,295
Every detachment aside from the Kremlin regiment

1050
01:11:48,701 --> 01:11:50,074
are stationed at summer camps.

1051
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,887
Besides, today

1052
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:53,575
is Ivan's day.
<i>(Ivan Kupala; Saint John's Eve, summer solstice)</i>

1053
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,353
So what?
- It's our main holiday.

1054
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,066
And what do the Latvians think?

1055
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:58,906
Are you certain about them?

1056
01:11:59,373 --> 01:12:02,090
We have information on the SRs
having done some work there.

1057
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,400
But with what results, hard to say.
- Right.

1058
01:12:05,733 --> 01:12:07,130
I called for Vatsetis.

1059
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,920
He's handling operations with Muralov.

1060
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,070
I want to send him to the Latvians.
- Out of the question.

1061
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:16,343
He's a seasoned military man, we
should leave him on operations.

1062
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:17,996
It's better to send...

1063
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,520
a good party worker, a Latvian.

1064
01:12:20,573 --> 01:12:21,706
We should send Danishevsky.

1065
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,040
I'll call for him.

1066
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:29,760
How...

1067
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,440
How does Vatsetis evaluate the situation?

1068
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:35,440
Where is he?

1069
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,140
He's here, Vladimir Ilyich.

1070
01:12:53,549 --> 01:12:54,889
Comrade Vatsetis.

1071
01:12:56,503 --> 01:12:57,610
Can we hold out until morning?

1072
01:13:01,056 --> 01:13:02,902
The situation is unclear, Vladimir Ilyich.

1073
01:13:03,396 --> 01:13:04,602
We're almost out of troops.

1074
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:08,210
Comrade Podvoysky and I, we want
to go survey the city, but we need time.

1075
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,540
How much?

1076
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,850
A couple hours, Vladimir Ilyich.
- Yes.

1077
01:13:11,113 --> 01:13:12,666
We'll give you an answer in two hours.

1078
01:13:13,573 --> 01:13:15,740
It's almost 10, and very little has been done so far.

1079
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,126
We're constantly losing initiative.

1080
01:13:20,339 --> 01:13:21,759
I need you to understand this.

1081
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,919
An pass it on to all the comrades.

1082
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:29,471
If we don't take some desperate measures to turn this slop

1083
01:13:30,498 --> 01:13:31,566
into something solid,

1084
01:13:32,937 --> 01:13:34,011
we'll get toppled.

1085
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,397
The situation is out of hand.

1086
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:39,300
Badly.

1087
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:41,310
I will be waiting.

1088
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,610
What?

1089
01:13:57,116 --> 01:13:58,140
Not answering.

1090
01:14:00,326 --> 01:14:01,873
Maybe we should send another telegram?

1091
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,520
Ioffe isn't answering because the Germans aren't answering.
<i>Adolf Abramovich Ioffe, RSFSR ambassador in Germany</i>

1092
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:15,423
Vladimir Ilyich, Danishevsky is waiting.

1093
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:20,876
So what, comrade Danishevsky?

1094
01:14:23,236 --> 01:14:24,616
I don't have to explain it to you.

1095
01:14:26,116 --> 01:14:28,089
The Brest Peace has deprived Latvians of their motherland.

1096
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:30,929
Perfect grounds for SR agitation.

1097
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:36,063
Go now.

1098
01:14:36,903 --> 01:14:38,976
And come back no matter what.

1099
01:14:39,869 --> 01:14:43,040
We must know if we should be expecting these
regiments or taking other measures.

1100
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,160
I'll try, Vladimir Ilyich.

1101
01:14:49,356 --> 01:14:50,370
Vladimir Ilyich.

1102
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,063
I'm going to Dmitrovka.

1103
01:14:52,356 --> 01:14:53,660
Our faction is gathering there.

1104
01:14:55,703 --> 01:14:57,436
Mobilize every government member,

1105
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,629
central committee members too.

1106
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:01,125
We'll arm the worker detachments and be ready.

1107
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,766
Accompanying the district delegates will be...

1108
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:05,500
Smidovich to Sokolniki.

1109
01:15:06,059 --> 01:15:07,852
Skrypnik to the Rogozhko-Simonovsky district.

1110
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,943
Zinovyev to Gorodskoy, Tsuryupa and Schlichter to Zamoskvorechye.

1111
01:15:10,983 --> 01:15:12,437
Schlichter's better for Lefortovo.

1112
01:15:13,236 --> 01:15:14,310
Alright.

1113
01:15:15,056 --> 01:15:18,620
Teodorovich and Podbelsky to Basmanny,
Kamenev to Trubnaya.

1114
01:15:19,009 --> 01:15:20,040
And to Presnya?

1115
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,390
Bubnov.

1116
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:26,330
Lenin's at Sovnarkom, Sverdlov's at Congress, Bukharin's at <i>Pravda</i>, Steklov's at <i>Izvestiya</i>,

1117
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:30,530
Sklyansky is at the War Commissariat...
- Let him focus on Yaroslavl.

1118
01:15:30,843 --> 01:15:32,356
Completely! Lashevich too.

1119
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:33,690
Alright.

1120
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:36,679
Ioffe's in Berlin, Petrovsky, Artyom and Kollontai are in Ukraine,

1121
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:38,280
Stalin is in Tsaritsyn,

1122
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,420
Rykov is in Kazan...
- Send Stalin and Rykov detailed telegrams on everything.

1123
01:15:41,899 --> 01:15:44,206
We should send Uritsky and Zaslavsky to Peter.
<i>Saint Petersburg</i>

1124
01:15:44,813 --> 01:15:46,953
In case SRs plot something there as well.

1125
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,763
Yeah...

1126
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,190
The question

1127
01:15:57,326 --> 01:15:59,206
of the Latvian division

1128
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:01,779
isn't just military.

1129
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,245
It's a political question now.

1130
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,880
If the Latvians,

1131
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:11,700
whom SRs promised to return the motherland to,

1132
01:16:12,953 --> 01:16:14,500
will stand against the rebels,

1133
01:16:16,233 --> 01:16:18,186
it will prove to everyone

1134
01:16:18,493 --> 01:16:19,686
that our policy is correct.

1135
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,130
But if they don't...

1136
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:35,405
SR troops have surrounded the city center.

1137
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,693
Stop there!

1138
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,460
Papers.

1139
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:51,656
Surname?

1140
01:16:51,776 --> 01:16:52,800
Danishevsky.

1141
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:57,170
The car has been requisitioned for the Left SR party. Come out.

1142
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,670
We aren't going anywhere.

1143
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:00,469
Where's your commander?

1144
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,296
Yeryokhin!

1145
01:17:03,896 --> 01:17:05,116
Yeryokhin, it's for you.

1146
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:08,370
Who might you be?
- Latvian Riflemen.

1147
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,560
Let them through.

1148
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,846
You may pass, comrades.

1149
01:17:15,543 --> 01:17:16,623
Let them through!

1150
01:17:17,476 --> 01:17:19,170
We're expecting you, comrades!

1151
01:17:19,789 --> 01:17:24,536
Malaya Dmitrovka street, 6.
 22:10

1152
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,830
Comrades!

1153
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,350
Left SR party has mutinied!

1154
01:17:30,243 --> 01:17:31,723
Dzerzhinsky has been arrested.

1155
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,263
A Congress delegate has been murdered.

1156
01:17:34,556 --> 01:17:35,610
Abelman.

1157
01:17:36,116 --> 01:17:38,215
The situation is extremely grave.

1158
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:40,409
There has been a proposition

1159
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,633
to spread all the members of our faction
 around Moscow districts

1160
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,380
to assist the local forces.

1161
01:17:47,653 --> 01:17:48,599
At stake

1162
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:51,573
is the very existence of the Soviet proletarian power.

1163
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:53,466
The fate of the revolution.

1164
01:17:53,806 --> 01:17:55,072
Assigned to the districts:

1165
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,200
Basmanny district.

1166
01:17:58,012 --> 01:17:59,070
Ananyin.

1167
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:00,285
Gulevsky.

1168
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,340
Paul.

1169
01:18:01,809 --> 01:18:02,850
Kozlov.

1170
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,080
Baranov.

1171
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,480
Gorkin.

1172
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,560
Melnikov.

1173
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,700
Mayorov.

1174
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,780
Stepanov.

1175
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:11,010
Krzhanovsky.

1176
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,270
Trofimov.

1177
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,486
Tumanyan.

1178
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,506
Zyuzin.

1179
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,690
Pavlov.

1180
01:18:15,786 --> 01:18:16,719
Gorlova.

1181
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:17,506
Shurov.

1182
01:18:17,783 --> 01:18:18,783
Armand.

1183
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:19,890
Kochetkov.

1184
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,060
Smirnov.

1185
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,147
Feldman.

1186
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,340
Mikharilov.

1187
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,420
Tsvetkov.

1188
01:18:24,493 --> 01:18:25,240
Vikman.

1189
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:26,430
Zavyalov.

1190
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,600
Fazanov.

1191
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,680
Ogurchikov.

1192
01:18:28,753 --> 01:18:29,493
Titov.

1193
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:30,427
Schlichte.

1194
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,719
Rallies have started up in Moscow worker districts.

1195
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:36,340
It has been done dishonorably!

1196
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,913
It has been done in the Soviet power name!

1197
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,266
It is a betrayal

1198
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:43,672
the likes of which has not been known in history,
<i>Congress delegate Inessa Armand</i>

1199
01:18:43,697 --> 01:18:45,073
at least the history of revolution!

1200
01:18:45,219 --> 01:18:47,405
It's an act of treachery that could only be done

1201
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:49,605
by Azefs of the revolution!
<i>Yevno Azef, agent provocateur for Okrana in the SR organization</i>

1202
01:18:49,746 --> 01:18:53,659
It is a fall that a political party could not ever recover from.

1203
01:18:53,826 --> 01:18:57,860
At two Soviet Congresses, the absolute majority

1204
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,099
has unequivocally voice their will:

1205
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:03,644
peace and peace only!

1206
01:19:04,064 --> 01:19:08,390
And if a Soviet party proclaims the right
<i>Lunacharsky, People's Commissar for Education</i>

1207
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:11,610
at any moment interdict a Soviet decision

1208
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,500
<i>Shulgin...</i>

1209
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:15,316
I shall allow myself to note that that party,

1210
01:19:15,469 --> 01:19:18,189
in boundaries of the present state,

1211
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:19,695
has no place to exist!

1212
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:21,875
Claiming for themselves a monopoly

1213
01:19:21,975 --> 01:19:23,822
on custody of the world revolution,

1214
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,210
Left SRs are in fact shooting it in the back.

1215
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:29,180
Vladimir Ilyich was right saying
<i>Frunze, Congress delegate</i>

1216
01:19:29,843 --> 01:19:32,536
that we should fight a revolutionary slogan

1217
01:19:32,789 --> 01:19:34,903
so they don't say about us later

1218
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,840
that a revolutionary slogan

1219
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:39,153
about a revolutionary war

1220
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:40,439
brought the revolution's demise!

1221
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:44,720
Everyone should understand we're not talking about
one ruling party taking the place of another's.

1222
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:47,900
If the Soviet power slips today,
<i>Bubnov, RKP central committee member</i>

1223
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:51,032
tomorrow the counter-revolution will have the power

1224
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,980
to crush any revolutionary force like an iron mill

1225
01:19:55,193 --> 01:19:58,246
not bothering to tell Bolsheviks from SRs!

1226
01:19:58,339 --> 01:20:02,010
At this difficult moment when the fate
of our conquests is being decided,

1227
01:20:02,592 --> 01:20:06,110
the Russian Communist Bolshevik party is certain
<i>Karpov, Congress delegate</i>

1228
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:10,631
that you will stand up to defend
these proletarian conquests.

1229
01:20:12,176 --> 01:20:14,490
We shall win this July
like we had won in October.

1230
01:20:14,782 --> 01:20:17,209
Worker Moscow was raising up.
- To Zamoskvorechye: Ivashov,

1231
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:18,468
Kutuzov,

1232
01:20:18,676 --> 01:20:19,449
Buravin,

1233
01:20:19,702 --> 01:20:20,502
Malyshev,

1234
01:20:20,866 --> 01:20:21,733
Dymnov,

1235
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,727
Nazarov,

1236
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,680
Ryabin,

1237
01:20:23,773 --> 01:20:24,560
Krivosheev,

1238
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:25,546
Kiselev,

1239
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:27,393
Gavrilin,

1240
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,806
The Kremlin. 23:30

1241
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,009
No.

1242
01:20:37,476 --> 01:20:39,089
You need an army to fight an army.

1243
01:20:40,362 --> 01:20:41,689
Workers should only fight

1244
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:44,022
as the last-ditch measure.

1245
01:20:45,868 --> 01:20:46,890
We wait.

1246
01:20:49,675 --> 01:20:50,975
I don't know, Vladimir Ilyich.

1247
01:20:58,456 --> 01:21:00,863
We can't put untrained people under fire.

1248
01:21:04,602 --> 01:21:05,756
What does Danishevsky say?

1249
01:21:06,076 --> 01:21:07,210
Vladimnir Ilyich, Berlin.

1250
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,690
Well, the murder of the ambassador
is too good of a trump card.

1251
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:36,830
It would be naive to think
the Germans wouldn't use it.

1252
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,356
That means we should expect the worst demands.

1253
01:21:40,743 --> 01:21:42,620
Yes indeed, that's what it means.

1254
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:46,250
And what would stop them,
especially in these cicrcumstances?

1255
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:48,495
You think Berlin already knows about the mutiny?

1256
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:49,835
I don't think it, I'm sure of it.

1257
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:52,430
Well then, let's forget about the Left SRs for a minute.

1258
01:21:53,096 --> 01:21:54,290
Georgiy Vasilyevich.

1259
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:58,189
Let us consider every possible German demand.

1260
01:21:59,202 --> 01:22:01,242
What could be the Germans' reaction tomorrow?

1261
01:22:02,022 --> 01:22:03,515
Breaking the Brest treaty,

1262
01:22:03,562 --> 01:22:06,620
ordering the army, which is still
quite capable, to march on Moscow.

1263
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,090
You want to start with this?

1264
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:10,296
Of course.

1265
01:22:10,563 --> 01:22:12,430
And our reparations talks?

1266
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:15,049
Why would the Germans want
to lose such a fortune?

1267
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,516
What are you talking
about, Vladimir Ilyich?

1268
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:20,597
The rewards of an offensive like that will
so far exceed your puny reparations

1269
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,479
that there can be no two opinions on this.

1270
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:27,256
Ruthless man, Georgiy Vasilyevich.

1271
01:22:31,629 --> 01:22:32,250
But how...

1272
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,330
War.

1273
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,636
So we go with what the SRs proposed?

1274
01:22:36,963 --> 01:22:38,383
That's exactly what they want.

1275
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:42,263
Well, maybe that is exactly the historical destiny of the Left SRs.

1276
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:47,916
To become the cherry pit we stumble
over, serving the White Guard's needs.

1277
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:54,623
Alright then.

1278
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,443
There's another possibility.

1279
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:03,916
They could demand increased security of the embassy.

1280
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,100
They would be welcome.

1281
01:23:05,543 --> 01:23:08,180
By admitting to Moscow a batallion, maybe a
regiment of their troops.

1282
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:11,136
Very well could be, there are precedents.

1283
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,283
Military presence for protection of their subjects.

1284
01:23:13,343 --> 01:23:14,696
Well, Georgiy Vasilyevich!

1285
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:16,680
We won't allow that.

1286
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:18,503
There are limits.

1287
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,689
We'll mobilize the entire people.

1288
01:23:22,023 --> 01:23:23,390
All adult population...

1289
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,450
So war?

1290
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:27,213
We're back to the beginning.

1291
01:23:28,847 --> 01:23:30,487
War, war, war...

1292
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:32,160
War is demise.

1293
01:23:33,226 --> 01:23:38,573
0:20
SRs took the VChK building and arrested Latsis.
(the rebellion chronicle)

1294
01:23:40,503 --> 01:23:42,890
Comrade Podvoysky, what do we do? A roadblock is ahead.

1295
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,213
Take the right.

1296
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,033
Stop!

1297
01:23:50,873 --> 01:23:51,553
Stop!

1298
01:23:52,863 --> 01:23:53,750
Stop I say!

1299
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,290
Now go straight ahead!

1300
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:57,017
Stop or I'll shoot!

1301
01:23:58,203 --> 01:23:59,570
Stop! Stop!

1302
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,103
Go to the Pokrovsky barracks!

1303
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:07,910
Right then.

1304
01:24:08,156 --> 01:24:10,836
1st March regiment has also taken the SR's side.

1305
01:24:11,502 --> 01:24:12,263
Stop here.

1306
01:24:17,495 --> 01:24:18,275
Back up!

1307
01:24:25,696 --> 01:24:27,370
Quick! Quick!

1308
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,900
We'll try to break through the Kursk station.

1309
01:24:35,847 --> 01:24:36,733
Stop!

1310
01:24:38,693 --> 01:24:39,907
Stop! Stop!

1311
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:43,899
Stop!

1312
01:24:49,925 --> 01:24:53,218
Popov's detachment. 0:40

1313
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:56,870
How could you go against the Soviet power?

1314
01:24:57,823 --> 01:24:58,963
Why against?

1315
01:24:59,043 --> 01:25:00,240
We're not against it.

1316
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:03,509
Popov himself said we're fighting for the Soviets.

1317
01:25:04,023 --> 01:25:05,400
But with no peace.

1318
01:25:05,923 --> 01:25:07,396
So you want to go to war again?

1319
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:08,770
We've got orders.

1320
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:09,936
Whose orders?

1321
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:12,216
Stop chatting. You are in prison.

1322
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:16,320
Felix Edmundovich!

1323
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:18,780
We all respect you.

1324
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:20,963
Our cause is honest and true.

1325
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:25,202
With us the whole Zamoskvorechye,
Pokrovsky barracks, the 1st March regiment.

1326
01:25:26,036 --> 01:25:28,763
Muravyev, the eastern front
commander, is on our side.

1327
01:25:29,626 --> 01:25:32,433
Stand with us, Felix Edmundovich!
- If I had a revolver right now,

1328
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,340
I would put a bullet in your head, you traitor.

1329
01:25:36,076 --> 01:25:37,156
Martin Yanovich.

1330
01:25:38,076 --> 01:25:39,150
Look at you.

1331
01:25:40,549 --> 01:25:42,030
You are a revolutionary.

1332
01:25:43,402 --> 01:25:44,689
Real comrade.

1333
01:25:45,149 --> 01:25:46,260
A Latvian.

1334
01:25:47,415 --> 01:25:51,981
Germans are choking Latvia, killing our comrades,
and you protect Mirbach? Aren't you ashamed?

1335
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:54,590
Oh I'm ashamed that I didn't kill you yesterday!

1336
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:56,340
You contra.
<i>counter-revolutionary</i>

1337
01:26:04,536 --> 01:26:05,816
So this is it then.

1338
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,330
If we don't get you,

1339
01:26:09,282 --> 01:26:11,635
Then you get us!
- Oh we will get you either way.

1340
01:26:14,382 --> 01:26:16,362
And why are you quite, Aleksandrovich?

1341
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:31,170
How could you.

1342
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:42,103
How could you.

1343
01:26:43,316 --> 01:26:44,636
I trusted you.

1344
01:26:45,902 --> 01:26:49,229
I am a Left SR party
member, Felix Edmundovich.

1345
01:26:50,015 --> 01:26:52,375
And I did what the CC of my party decided I should.

1346
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:55,200
Well then.

1347
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,007
Seeing you as a disciplined party member,

1348
01:27:00,219 --> 01:27:01,260
I'm shaking your hand.

1349
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:04,599
But as my VChK deputy,

1350
01:27:05,812 --> 01:27:07,259
I will get you a fire squad.

1351
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:13,899
1:10
SRs took the power station.
(the rebellion chronicle)

1352
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,480
Right now, the SRs have more than two thousand

1353
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,750
bayonets.

1354
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,580
Artillery,

1355
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,086
over sixty machine guns

1356
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:22,830
and several armored cars.

1357
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,703
I left Vatsetis

1358
01:27:26,236 --> 01:27:27,443
at Muralov's headquarters.

1359
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,010
I have matches.

1360
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,490
They have the power station.

1361
01:27:32,896 --> 01:27:34,896
Yes, Tsygankov's detachment
has been already sent there.

1362
01:27:36,682 --> 01:27:39,649
We have reinforced what little troops
we had with Congress delegates.

1363
01:27:39,948 --> 01:27:41,435
Distributed all the party cadres.

1364
01:27:41,762 --> 01:27:43,715
Sent comrades out to the rail stations,

1365
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,435
to the barracks, to separate batallions.

1366
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,136
But all that is not nearly enough.

1367
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:49,160
Not nearly enough, Vladimir Ilyich.

1368
01:27:50,176 --> 01:27:52,529
The SRs took the Chistye Prudy district,

1369
01:27:52,582 --> 01:27:54,876
took Vsesvyatskoye, took the entire Zamoskvorechye.

1370
01:27:55,902 --> 01:27:57,488
They drove us back over the Yauza

1371
01:27:57,548 --> 01:28:00,328
and are pulling their forces toward the
center now.

1372
01:28:00,968 --> 01:28:02,794
I barely managed to break through to you.

1373
01:28:03,461 --> 01:28:06,474
My impression is they are preparing to storm the Kremlin.

1374
01:28:06,534 --> 01:28:08,328
Vladimir Ilyich, Latsis has been arrested.

1375
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:10,967
The VChK building is overtaken by the SRs.

1376
01:28:11,394 --> 01:28:12,681
Kuznetsov came from there.

1377
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,940
Right.

1378
01:28:17,193 --> 01:28:18,326
Vladimir Ilyich.

1379
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,680
If we hear nothing from Danishevsky in an hour,

1380
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,386
we should arm the worker
detachments. There's no other way.

1381
01:28:26,726 --> 01:28:29,219
I'll go brief the comrades on the situation,

1382
01:28:29,806 --> 01:28:32,199
and we will think over the
defense measures for the Kremlin.

1383
01:28:37,876 --> 01:28:39,356
Call Peters.

1384
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:42,682
He's now appointed the VChK chairman.

1385
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:45,415
And call for Gorbunov, please.

1386
01:28:59,403 --> 01:29:00,549
Comrade Gorbunov.

1387
01:29:00,996 --> 01:29:03,809
Prepare everything necessary to move the government

1388
01:29:04,369 --> 01:29:06,276
to the Khodynka artillery barracks.

1389
01:29:08,429 --> 01:29:09,516
You understand me?

1390
01:29:10,289 --> 01:29:12,489
Popov's detachment 1:50
- The morning papers should be printed

1391
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:14,249
announcing the first session of the new government.

1392
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,515
And this session must be held in the Kremlin.

1393
01:29:16,989 --> 01:29:18,442
The Kremlin will be taken by morning.

1394
01:29:18,902 --> 01:29:20,602
The Kremlin must be taken by night.

1395
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:21,528
Now.

1396
01:29:21,595 --> 01:29:23,068
Immediately.
- No question.

1397
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:25,327
A night storm could cost us half the detachment.

1398
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:28,527
But by morning my hands will be untied,
and I will be able to use artillery.

1399
01:29:28,687 --> 01:29:30,650
Listen, two hours won't decide anything.

1400
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:34,370
Two hours can decide it all. Don't you understand
what is happening in the city? Tell him.

1401
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,770
In every district,

1402
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,570
the Bolsheviks are organizing worker detachments.

1403
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,110
They are for now poorly armed.

1404
01:29:40,562 --> 01:29:42,815
But by the morning they would be a serious force.

1405
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,126
Well that makes it worse!

1406
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,026
Comrades, we can't sacrifice the detachment!

1407
01:29:47,506 --> 01:29:48,246
Alright, it's decided.

1408
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,066
At 4:30 we start the shelling

1409
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,190
and immediately storm in. By 5 it will all be over.

1410
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,050
It's decided.

1411
01:29:59,226 --> 01:30:00,480
The main thing is to win.

1412
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,490
Then it all will settle down.

1413
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:06,272
Don't know who will win but I'm
afraid the revolution will be the loser.

1414
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:07,205
Comrade Proshyan,

1415
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:08,916
you should write a proclamation for the workers.

1416
01:30:09,569 --> 01:30:10,755
I will, I will.

1417
01:30:10,936 --> 01:30:13,489
Bolshoi Theatre. 2:10

1418
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:46,830
Where's Turov?

1419
01:30:47,263 --> 01:30:48,390
Turov's!

1420
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:57,591
We can't wait anymore, we must act.

1421
01:30:58,016 --> 01:31:00,096
We are about four hundred strong, many are armed.

1422
01:31:00,442 --> 01:31:01,609
The guard is no more than a hundred.

1423
01:31:01,962 --> 01:31:05,229
Break people into groups, disseminate orders. The signal is Varshavyanka*.
<i>Varshavyanka - Polish/Russian revolutionary song</i>

1424
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:11,176
2:30.
The SRs have taken the phone station and disconnected the Kremlin.
(the rebellion chronicle)

1425
01:31:11,223 --> 01:31:13,503
The Kremlin. 3:10

1426
01:31:42,926 --> 01:31:44,453
What if we don't say anything?

1427
01:31:57,890 --> 01:31:58,890
You?

1428
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,760
I'm a member of VTsIK*.
<i>VTsIK (ВЦИК) - All-Russian Central Executive Committee</i>

1429
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,413
Only the Congress can deprive me of authority.

1430
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:06,620
I need to speak with Vladimir Ilyich.

1431
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,163
Wait here.

1432
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,603
Vladimir Ilyich.

1433
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:21,190
Kolegayev is here to see you.

1434
01:32:25,323 --> 01:32:26,256
Who now?

1435
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,216
Yes, yes.

1436
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:28,950
Kolegayev Andrey Lukyanovich.

1437
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,400
There it is then.

1438
01:32:37,996 --> 01:32:39,156
An ultimatum.

1439
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:44,336
Well then.

1440
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:48,682
Ultimatum it is.

1441
01:32:49,075 --> 01:32:50,302
Invite him in.

1442
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,690
I do understand the sheer
absurdity of my appearance here.

1443
01:33:13,106 --> 01:33:15,186
But the revolution's fate is at stake.

1444
01:33:15,211 --> 01:33:16,566
We are listening.

1445
01:33:17,011 --> 01:33:20,180
Vladimir Ilyich, the revolution
is suffering a great tragedy.

1446
01:33:20,397 --> 01:33:22,537
We should stop. We are murdering the revolution.

1447
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,137
You tell this to us?

1448
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,820
I said the same over there.

1449
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:29,533
We should find common ground. We must talk it through.

1450
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,926
I don't understand you.

1451
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,100
What is this?

1452
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:37,969
A proposal of your party?

1453
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:43,629
Vladimir Ilyich, I'm here as a person who

1454
01:33:44,062 --> 01:33:46,582
holds our common cause interests most dear.

1455
01:33:46,635 --> 01:33:50,562
Excuse me, but we don't have time
for personal matters right now.

1456
01:33:52,135 --> 01:33:54,735
Vladimir Ilyich, you don't
have the right to say so.

1457
01:33:55,468 --> 01:33:57,881
We must stand above our parties' qualms.

1458
01:33:58,688 --> 01:34:02,234
The entire Russia's fate
may well depend on it.

1459
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:06,981
Understand, when Robespierre and Danton
couldn't strike a deal, only Napoleon won.

1460
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:10,815
What could be more terrible than a
schism among the revolutionaries?

1461
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,587
A fraudulent unity.

1462
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,613
There can be no unity with people

1463
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:21,506
who could at any moment put the
country at the brink of catastrophe,

1464
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:23,360
none!

1465
01:34:26,656 --> 01:34:31,410
Tell your friends, comrade Kolegayev, that
since yesterday, July the 6th, Russia

1466
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:34,036
has got one party fewer.

1467
01:34:34,349 --> 01:34:35,960
I quit that party.

1468
01:34:46,543 --> 01:34:48,689
Maybe they just mistreated you?

1469
01:34:49,843 --> 01:34:50,883
Vladimir Ilyich.

1470
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,480
When I worked under you
as a government member,

1471
01:34:54,946 --> 01:34:57,126
you had enough opportunity to see who I am.

1472
01:34:57,236 --> 01:34:59,303
You all fled the government.

1473
01:35:00,609 --> 01:35:02,649
You are a government member who fled.

1474
01:35:03,255 --> 01:35:04,469
To say it plainly,

1475
01:35:04,781 --> 01:35:05,935
a deserter.

1476
01:35:08,615 --> 01:35:10,288
You all are deserters

1477
01:35:11,255 --> 01:35:12,688
who got scared of

1478
01:35:14,088 --> 01:35:15,170
responsibility.

1479
01:35:15,275 --> 01:35:18,429
Vladimir Ilyich, we didn't want
to be responsible for your policy

1480
01:35:18,454 --> 01:35:19,950
because we didn't agree with it.

1481
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,094
But it was perfectly possible for you

1482
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,110
to stay in opposition and critique us.

1483
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,146
You had organization, newspapers, money.

1484
01:35:27,572 --> 01:35:28,746
You had everything

1485
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,396
an opposition party could dream of.

1486
01:35:30,936 --> 01:35:32,040
And you?

1487
01:35:33,022 --> 01:35:35,055
Instead of a loyal
opposition, conspirators.

1488
01:35:35,148 --> 01:35:37,028
Pawns in White Guard's hands.

1489
01:35:37,241 --> 01:35:39,540
Theirs and others'.
- Well, you are right about that.

1490
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,681
Of course.

1491
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:42,060
Suicides.

1492
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:45,223
A central committee of suicides.

1493
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,460
And I am sure that this whole adventure

1494
01:35:47,553 --> 01:35:50,603
will push away not only most
of your workers and peasants,

1495
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,117
but many of the intelligentsiya too.

1496
01:35:52,143 --> 01:35:55,223
And with these same people we'll form a new party.
- What party?

1497
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,909
- Revolutionary communist party.
- And you will insist again

1498
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,626
that no amount of human
sacrifice however great it is

1499
01:36:02,753 --> 01:36:05,906
must stop us on our way
to the world revolution?

1500
01:36:05,952 --> 01:36:07,587
Great goals, Vladimir Ilyich,

1501
01:36:07,612 --> 01:36:09,618
can't be reached without great sacrifice.

1502
01:36:09,705 --> 01:36:12,205
I know of only one great goal.

1503
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,146
Human happiness.

1504
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,493
And not of some

1505
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,236
abstract humans,

1506
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,963
but those same humans you intend

1507
01:36:22,093 --> 01:36:23,013
to sacrifice.

1508
01:36:23,099 --> 01:36:26,093
This is not the time for political debate!

1509
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:28,445
And even worse of a time

1510
01:36:29,292 --> 01:36:31,279
for political compromise.

1511
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:39,503
I am very sorry, Vladimir Ilyich, that we
can not understand each other in such a fatal way.

1512
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:41,160
Goodbye.

1513
01:36:42,553 --> 01:36:43,646
Goodbye.

1514
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:56,363
Vladimir Ilyich, sorry, have you read it?

1515
01:36:58,702 --> 01:36:59,760
Yes.

1516
01:37:00,469 --> 01:37:01,530
Almost.

1517
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,822
There are some margin notes.

1518
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:08,063
What's in the city?

1519
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:11,300
An SR detachment arrived
to the Nikolaevsky station.

1520
01:37:11,536 --> 01:37:12,690
The backup.

1521
01:37:12,876 --> 01:37:14,040
Probably.

1522
01:37:14,306 --> 01:37:16,540
The Basmanny district worker
militia was able to disarm them.

1523
01:37:16,573 --> 01:37:18,326
- How many were there?
- About a hundred.

1524
01:37:19,939 --> 01:37:22,219
Increased activity of the SRs in Bolshoi Theatre.

1525
01:37:22,612 --> 01:37:23,850
Peters' report.

1526
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:25,358
Chewing us out?

1527
01:37:26,124 --> 01:37:27,164
Singing songs.

1528
01:37:27,353 --> 01:37:28,893
Each more revolutionary than the last.

1529
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,046
Are they armed?

1530
01:37:32,139 --> 01:37:33,212
They could be.

1531
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:49,380
To Peters.

1532
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,587
Bolshoi Theatre

1533
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:52,946
Citizens SRs,

1534
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:58,700
The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission
invites you all to give up your weapons.

1535
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:00,378
Don't do it comrades!

1536
01:38:00,765 --> 01:38:01,772
This is an outrage!

1537
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:05,203
We won't give up our arms!

1538
01:38:07,129 --> 01:38:09,800
To the odious and disgraceful demand
to give up or weapons

1539
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:11,175
we answer with a refusal!

1540
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:15,930
Those detained in possession
of arms in an hour

1541
01:38:16,854 --> 01:38:20,127
will be judged with all the
severity of revolutionary law.

1542
01:38:22,191 --> 01:38:24,665
Tell Lenin and Sverdlov

1543
01:38:24,777 --> 01:38:27,071
we don't want to take part in this comedy.

1544
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:29,931
We don't recognize your
judgement and never will!

1545
01:38:39,383 --> 01:38:41,323
Please give up your weapons.

1546
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:51,990
Please.

1547
01:39:10,123 --> 01:39:13,469
Please follow the example
of citizen Spiridonova.

1548
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,263
It's our fire!

1549
01:39:40,646 --> 01:39:42,880
Keep your heads up comrades!

1550
01:39:43,346 --> 01:39:45,079
Long live the revolution!

1551
01:39:45,459 --> 01:39:49,399
The Kremlin. 4:35

1552
01:40:01,363 --> 01:40:02,969
They're starting with cannons...

1553
01:40:05,196 --> 01:40:06,570
Well, well.

1554
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:21,890
Ivan Vasilyevich, please
check with the guardposts.

1555
01:40:22,897 --> 01:40:23,897
They're starting.

1556
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:24,960
Looks like it.

1557
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:53,163
Vladimir Ilyich!

1558
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:56,193
The Latvian division is entering the city.

1559
01:41:11,303 --> 01:41:16,799
At 5:10 the Latvian Riflemen division entered
Moscow from Khodynka side.
(the rebellion chronicle)

1560
01:41:16,913 --> 01:41:18,672
The Kremlin. 5:40

1561
01:41:18,752 --> 01:41:22,525
These troops should be placed around the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour

1562
01:41:22,759 --> 01:41:24,245
and Strastnaya Square.

1563
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:26,370
Your regiment stays in reserves.

1564
01:41:26,559 --> 01:41:27,759
Move it

1565
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:29,450
to Arbat, here.

1566
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,410
We must remember

1567
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:32,736
that the opposing force

1568
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:34,843
is still largely surpassing our own.

1569
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:37,330
The main strike should occur at the A ring.

1570
01:41:37,603 --> 01:41:39,129
Your regiments should march there.

1571
01:41:39,229 --> 01:41:41,249
And from here, from the Pokrovsky Gate.

1572
01:41:41,462 --> 01:41:42,722
Also from there

1573
01:41:42,982 --> 01:41:44,389
we will start shelling

1574
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:47,780
of the Tryohsvyatitelsky alley.
- The artillery wouldn't pass from the Pokrovka.

1575
01:41:48,169 --> 01:41:49,283
It's all dug up.

1576
01:41:49,616 --> 01:41:50,640
I know.

1577
01:41:51,349 --> 01:41:53,060
The guns will have to be pulled by hand.

1578
01:41:53,795 --> 01:41:55,262
At the time of the storm

1579
01:41:55,315 --> 01:41:57,468
the guns will open on the SR headquarters.

1580
01:41:58,088 --> 01:41:59,741
We'll hold off with the artillery.

1581
01:42:01,074 --> 01:42:02,634
We should offer them a chance to surrender.

1582
01:42:05,134 --> 01:42:07,013
Give them twenty minutes to think it over.

1583
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,250
Alright.

1584
01:42:12,603 --> 01:42:13,650
We will try it.

1585
01:42:16,009 --> 01:42:17,013
Your batallion,

1586
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:18,060
Dudin's regiment

1587
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:19,453
and the artillery cadets

1588
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,200
should take all the bridges

1589
01:42:21,352 --> 01:42:22,440
and checkpoints.

1590
01:42:23,146 --> 01:42:25,852
In no circumstances the SR troops

1591
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:27,885
stationed in the Pokrovsky barracks

1592
01:42:28,006 --> 01:42:29,706
should be allowed to join the main forces.

1593
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:31,832
Is this clear, comrades?

1594
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:35,324
Any questions?
- I need machine guns.

1595
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:36,623
- How many?
- Two or three.

1596
01:42:37,616 --> 01:42:39,143
Can we get some, comrade Vatsetis?

1597
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,013
I must think about it.

1598
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:31,849
Vladimir Ilyich,

1599
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,080
they are shelling the Kremlin.

1600
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:37,890
I can see it.

1601
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:50,150
Well then.

1602
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:54,436
They've made their choice.

1603
01:43:56,603 --> 01:43:59,430
6:10

1604
01:44:40,143 --> 01:44:41,160
Where to, Vladimir Ilyich?

1605
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:44,670
Sokolniki.

1606
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,706
We won't be back in an hour,

1607
01:44:46,753 --> 01:44:48,419
and they are still shooting there.
- Sokolniki.

1608
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:55,570
The All-Russian Congress of Soviets

1609
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:57,276
reconvenes.

1610
01:45:57,533 --> 01:46:06,207
July 9th 1918.
The 5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets
reconvened.
